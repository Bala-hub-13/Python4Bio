# ðŸ§¬ Python4Bio

Welcome to **Python4Bio**, a collection of small, beginner-friendly bioinformatics scripts written in plain, painfully understandable Python.

This repo is for anyone who:
- Knows what DNA is but not how to *code* with it
- Wants to learn bioinformatics the slow, careful way (step-by-step, with comments)
- Needs working examples of things like GC content, transcription, reverse complements.
## Basically, Me!

If you're expecting machine learning pipelines or genome assembly wizardry, you've taken a wrong turn.

## ðŸ§  What to expect?

Each script in this repo is written with simplicity and clarity in mind. They're just... understandable.


## ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists

I created **Python4Bio** as a way to learn and think through biological coding problems in Python, one mini-script at a time. Every file here is:
- Short
- Commented to death
- Written in logical, small chunks
- Designed to be hackable and tweakable for learning

If you like slow, thoughtful code that builds up piece by piece â€” like LEGO for bio nerds â€” this is the place.
