# ðŸ§¬ Python4Bio

Welcome to **Python4Bio**, a collection of small, beginner-friendly bioinformatics scripts written in plain, painfully understandable Python.

## ðŸ§  What to expect?

Each notebook in this repo is written with simplicity and clarity in mind. They're just... understandable.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists

I created **Python4Bio** as a way to learn and think through biological coding problems in Python, one mini-script at a time. Every file here is:
- Short
- Commented to death
- Written in logical, small chunks
- Designed to be hackable and tweakable for learning(No to packages- when you're starting out)

#### Basically, I just wanted to see all the broken code versions and sigh!
